Tech Experts: Incorporate detailed diagrams, schematics, and data charts that align with their advanced understanding.
Non-Experts: Utilize simplified visuals like infographics and basic charts to illustrate key points, aiding in comprehension without technical overload.

6. Purpose and Context:
Tech Experts: Align content with their goals, such as optimizing systems or understanding intricate functionalities.
Non-Experts: Focus on how the information affects them, highlighting practical benefits and real-world applications.
